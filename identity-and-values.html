  <h1>My Identity and Values</h1>
  <h2>Culture and Enviornment:</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Having spent the majority of my life in Santa Cruz, California and the Bay Area has allowed me to experience a range of religions and cultures. I am so grateful for this experience as it has led me to be curious and to have an open mind.</li>
    <li>Although it would probably be impossible to convert me to fundamentalist religion, I have been exposed to many different religions and schools of thought. I am so grateful for this. I consider myself a spiritual person and relate to various teachings. My connection to my spiritual self allows me to feel in tune with the world around me. I am a deeply feeling and empathetic person who finds joy connecting with wild ideas, unruly, playful and curious minds, even though I come across as quite shy and reserved at first.</li>
    <li>I grew up in a town with the slogan "Keep Santa Cruz Weird", a bookshop owner came up with it in support of the street performers. My home town had fire dancers, stilt walkers, samba dancers, dance studios, aerial artists, sand sculptors, buskers, a man that walked up and down the street dressed head to toe in pink in slow motion, artists selling airbrushed paintings, jewelry makers, open studios, galleries, and events. It was a fun, lively, adventurous creative place.</li>
    <li>The sound of the ocean and the screams from a nearby roller coaster were my daily white noise. The cooling mist of the ocean and the warm hug from the sun, along with the vivid sunsets rippling along the waves are memories that I hold with me. I lived in the redwoods as well, with deer nibbling at the garden, the sound of crickets in the night, skunks darting across the road, and raccoons getting up to mischief.</li>
    <li>I spent many summers in the Arizona desert, where there was craft and creativity, and the red rocks and vastness of the canyon, the plateau, and caves had an ancient sense of mysticism and wonder. The warm nights and booming thunder with lightning streaking across a violet sky left a vivid memory - I can almost feel the humidity and my racing heartbeat pounding in my chest as I ran through the warm rain to escape the threat of lightning.</li>
    <li>My family was divided and my cultural experience as well. Both sides had big family gatherings around the holidays - each different and special in their own ways. All with a focus on connection, joyful company and living in the moment. I am grateful for the lessons I have received through my unique life experiences despite the hardship we also faced through it.</li>
    <li>I have long been a person who sees the beauty in my surroundings and wants to capture it in some way so that it can be shared and reflected on.</li>
    <li>Having a divided family has strengthen my values for security and dependability. I would not have gotten to where I am today had I not recognised when this was being offered to me from multiple sources, situations, and people, and accepted it with gratitude.</li>
    <li>Having connection to my Japanese ancestry through my grandfather has given me a more worldly view. Having close family that valued travel and cultural experience sparked my curiosity in the world, in history and in people. Having a grandmother author encouraged me to expand my world through reading and I would dream up visuals to go along with the text on page, sometimes drifting into the comfort of an imaginary world.</li>
    <li>My culture has given me the opportunity to relate to many different types of people.Through which I have tuned in my emphatic nature and continually work on developing a more compassionate outlook.</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Key Values:</h2>

  <h2>Evidence of Values:</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Humour and Joy</strong> - I regularly make a clown of myself for the purpose of amusing myself and my partner. I also most enjoy when I feel comfortable to act completely goofy with close friends, and when I am around people that are funny. I appreciate humour that is intelligent and quick witted, but not humour that is sarcastic or mean spirited.</li>
    <li><strong>Dependability, Effort, Flexibility</strong> -  I show up on time, work overtime when needed, put in my best effort with all that I do, and often achieve better than what is asked. I am receptive to new ideas, am not overly-attached to my ideas, and can change my approach as needed. I have shown this in my educational output, my creative work, my volunteer work, and my administration roles.</li>
    <li><strong>Kindness and Empathy</strong> - I am a good listener and take the time to talk through things. I am able to see the big picture and put others needs before my own where appropriate.</li>
    <li><strong>Trust</strong> - worked in film and as an EA</li>
    <li><strong>Community</strong> - I love being part of a community. Being part of a community makes me feel alive and valued. A few examples of times that I have felt a part of communities are: 
      The dance community when I was salsa and samba dancing
      The music community when on tour with my musician partner and our musician whƒÅnau
      The artist community when I was working with textiles in film and as an art student at Cabrillo College and a theatre arts student at UCSC. These were times when I really felt that I was a contributing and welcomed member of the artist community.</li>
    <li><strong>Generosity and Kindness</strong> - giving to others unconditionally because I respect human beings. I do not like to see anyone suffer, even if others have been unkind to me, I do not want them to suffer.</li>
    <li><strong>Beauty</strong> - Both my ex-partner and one of my best friends from art school remembers a shoot that I did with my friend Valeri Schwartz. It was a circus-themed fashion video on a carousel and around sites in the Bay Area. My ex-partner said, "Elysia generated an energy which spread to others and all felt magical, alive, and spontaneous." My bestie said, "Elysia made a film of a costume she made and her adventures in the costume. It was her style, and direction. It made her happy." My other friend recalled other moments and said "When she [Elysia] can enhance an environment to attain a desired feeling, she lights up!"</li>
    <li><strong>Vision</strong> - working as a costume designer and being requested for projects.</li>
    <li><strong>Communication and Honesty</strong>I share my view and feelings about how some situations have affected me, (when I beleive it will create beneficial for others to do so), even when it is difficult for me.</li>
    <li><strong>Effort</strong> - Getting straight As at Cabrillo after struggling in high school, getting my BFA and MA degrees, moving to New Zealand</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Ethical Dilemma:</h2>
   <p>I had a situation where I felt that I was being put in the middle of a disagreement between a family member and a new close friend. This was really hard for me as I didn't like to see my friend upset. I also didn't like the effect that the disagreement had on my family member. I wanted to be a dependable friend, so I listened to my friend explain why they were offended and felt wronged, and talked to them to try and help create peace and understanding. A  few weeks later we met up for a drink and they didn't bring up the disagreement, and neither did I. I trusted that they would bring it up if they needed to, and since they hadn't I thought they had moved past it. We exchanged several normal text messages and I said we should have a hang out soon. I quickly learned that they were still upset about the disagreement.</p>

   <p>I wanted to be there for my friend, but I didn't want to disrespect my family member by apologising on their behalf. I felt it wasn't my place to do so, and from my perspective, there was a simple misunderstanding that was not made with malice and did not result in harm. I didn't know how to help my friend move on from the disagreement, it seemed like they needed time and space. I didn't like that I was put in the middle of the disagreement, and in hindsight I should have recognised that the balance was off and insisted that they speak directly to the person they were upset with.</p>  

   <p>I was honest and straightforward with my friend about my feelings and view of the situation, as it was affecting our friendship which I really cared about. I tried to deliver my message with clarity and kindness, offered another opportunity to connect in person, and let them know that I understood if they needed to take some space. I received a sarcastic comment in return. This was very hurtful to me, but I understood that they were suffering. I had done my best to communicate with honesty.</p>

   <p>I don't hold a grudge against the friend - I still wish they were my friend and would be glad if they wanted to re-connect. After the sarcastic comment, I made a couple more gentle attempts to open the door for communication, but it hasn't happened yet.</p>  

   <p>My strategy of dependability, effort, honesty, and compassion wasn't effective - I think because the balance and trust were off. In the future, I would encourage the people in disagreement to talk to each other directly.</p>
