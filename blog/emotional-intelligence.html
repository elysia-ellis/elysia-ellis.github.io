    <h2>Cultural Blog - Emotional Intelligence (aka. EQ - Emotional Quotient) </h2>
    <h3>Qualities of Emotional Intelligence</h3>
      <p>Emotional intelligence is an intelligence that includes the ability to recognise, understand, and manage one's own emotions and actions. It is a type of intelligence that allows one move through each day with greater ease while creating good outcomes. The ability to intuite, sense, respond, and motivate are skills included in emotional intelligence.</p>
      <p>Emotional intelligence allows a person to guide themselves and influence others towards positive thought and action through a wide range of skills relating to understanding oneself and others.</p>
      <p>Emotional intelligent people are in touch with their thought processes and can relate well to others. They understand and care about creating positive experiences for themselves and others.</p>
      <p>Key characteristics of emotionally intelligent people include the ability to:</p>
      <ul><strong>Recognise and differentiate between emotions</strong> - identify emotions arising within themselves and in others</ul>
      <ul><strong>Understand emotions and actions</strong> - reflect on them / be aware of the effects and consequences / sense the intensity of an emotion</ul>
      <ul><strong>Control one's own emotions, impulses, and actions</strong> - consciously and skillfully tap into a different emotional state if an unhelpful one arises / consciously make a choice with the intent to influence or achieve a positive outcome</ul>
      <ul><strong>Engage in beneficial verbal and non-verbal communication</strong> - Send out meaningful signals / create an easy flowing and productive atmosphere / utilise clear and appropriate emotions and actions for expression and response / adjust style of communication to suit various social situations and environments</ul>
      <ul><strong>Have empathy</strong> - maintain a good sense of others feelings and needs</ul>
      <ul><strong>Observe, relate and respond to others with sensitivity</strong></ul>
      <ul><strong>Maintain a healthy and balanced emotional state</strong></ul>
    <h3>EQ vs IQ</h3>
      <p>Upon taking seprate EQ and IQ tests, it became apparent to me that EQ is about soft skills and IQ is about hard skills. These types of intelligence connect to distinct intellectual frameworks.</p>
      <p>The IQ test felt like it was connecting to my inherent capabilities.The IQ test was deliberate and strategic. My mind was working like a rubix cube, flipping and analysing as the patterns that I was seeking in the test grew more challenging. I was utilising a part of myself that was not consciously connected to my emotional state. It felt like it connected to the part of me that I use when doing a task like turning on the shower, typing on the computer, searching for typos in a document, unloading the dishwasher, reading an instruction manual, playing solitaire, or looking for vegetables to harvest from the garden. IQ has to do with focus, memory, spatial awareness, knowledge, and technical ability.</p>
      <p>In the EQ test, I felt connected to a conscious state of mind. The EQ test was about recognising the facial expressions of others. I shifted directly into my feeling and judging state, with a desire to thoughtfully sense, analyse, and respond.</p>
      <p>EQ can grow through conscious nurturing and development in a person. IQ is said to be more static, primarily related to genetics and childhood environments.</p>
      <p>As they hop into the pond, the duckies decide to spread out. The space between them is the water in the pond. For a web developer, this negative space is called a margin. The larger the margin number, the more negative space there will be between blocks of content of a website.</p>
    <h3>The Importance of Emotional Intelligence</h3>
      <p>EQ is important because it:</p>
      <ul>
          <li>Leads one to make ethical and responsible choices that not only feel good to oneself, but also feels good to others</li>
          <li>Allows one to connect productively with others, forming healthy and positive relationships with trust and understanding</li>
          <li>Encourages peace and understanding</li>
          <li>Allows one to show up as the best version of oneself</li>
          <li>Teaches through experience and reflection; this creates a natural flow of self-improvement, which ultimately increases confidence</li>
          <li>Creates opportunities for growth and personal development</li>
      </ul>
