            <h2>Core Learnings - Foundations Reflection</h2>
              <div id="self-ego">
                <h3>Three new things I've learned about myself and my ego as a result of the core learning</h3>
                  <p>
                    Having a sense of purpose in the world and using my time wisely to make a positive impact has been important to me for a long time. This could be ego speaking, and I have been challenged previously, with people saying work doesn't need to be meaningful, but for some reason, this is a value that has been instilled in me. It probably has to do with my value of effort. I want to make an effort, and part of this effort will require me to work on my core skills so that I can show up for myself and for others, and live with purpose.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    I need to build different habits, habits that will benefit my overall health. Part of this is setting aside my ego, taking a step back, sleeping when I need to (ie. not staying up half the night), and asking for help when I need it (asking early and in the appropriate manner). I need to employ my value of balance and compassion to myself more often.
                  </p>                
                  <p>
                    One of the new habits I need to practice is finding productive ways, like employing mindfulness practices, to get over fixed mindset hurdles when they arise. I need to be able to keep my mind clear of negativity if I want to solve a problem.

                <h3>The roles of values, empathy, and self awareness in learning and programming</h3>
                  <h4>Self Awareness</h4>
                    <p>
                      A key reason that self-awareness is important is, how we interact with ourselves influences how we show up each moment and interact with others. Having strong self awareness means that you won't have an unintentional negative impact on others. Self-awareness allows one to reflect, ask questions, and look at ways to improve oneself. It allows for growth.
                    </p>
                  <h4>Values</h4>
                    <p>
                      Having an understanding of one's values allows a person to consider if one's values are being lived through themself. If we can live in alignment with our values, we will be able to show up with authenticity as our true selves. When operating from our true selves, we will be bringing our best to the table. When we bring our best to the table, we will be able to do our best work, and show respect to ourselves and to others during the process.
                    </p>
                  <h4>Empathy</h4>
                    <p>
                      When we are empathetic, we can sense others - how they might be feeling or thinking, we can relate to them and respond with compassion.
                      In learning and programming, having empathy will allow us to see things from other people's perspectives. This is important if we're going to have positive interactions and collaborations with others, we want to be able to understand and respond to people. 
                      As a web developer, one is building tools that will be of benefit to others, and by being able to sense others perspectives, needs, and emotions, we'll be able to build better tools that work for more people.

                  <h3>Biggest Surprise in Core Learning</h3>
                  <p>
                    I found aspects of the core learning familiar, but a lot of it was new, and some of it required a deep dive into my mind, and to places that weren't always comfortable to confront. I found it a fascinating process, and doing this work alongside the tech felt like a really necessary balance. It helped me realize how important it is to keep checking in with oneself to progress and make positive changes in how one operates, to be in alignment with one's true self. Going into this programme, I thought that I had strong core skills, but I knew there was room for improvement and this Foundations curriculum highlighted what some of those changes need to be. I don't think that core learning ends, and that is actually exciting as it means we can keep growing and improving ourselves. I loved learning more about the growth mindset and neuroplasticity. There are infinite opportunities to grow and change.

                  <h3>Biggest Challenges of Core Learning</h3>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Putting my full learning plan to practice was difficult. I had the best intentions, but I have strong neural pathways to old habits, and it's going to take time to build up the new pathways for my new habits.</li>
                    <li>Sticking to the timeboxes. I found that it was easy to want to do a deep dive on a lot of topics.</li>

                  <h3>Why Does Enspiral Dev Academy Teach Core?</h3>
                    <p>Here are some of the reasons why I think a programming school teaches core:</p>
                    <ul>
                      <li>So that we can live up to our full potential of being people with high EQs, creating peace, happiness, and raising the vibe wherever we go;</li>
                      <li>Because the world needs more people who are about tackling problems with clarity, enthusiasm, and empathy;</li>
                      <li>It affects the way people collaborate and interact with others;</li>
                      <li>In order for people to be effective at their work, they need to have good core skills;</li>
                      <li>People with good core skills will make positive contributions to their field, by approaching their work and others with a broader perspective and understanding;</li>
                      <li>Because EDA cares about graduating students who will build an inclusive and beneficial internet, because the internet has become a tool used by much of humanity, and it needs to be crafted with care by good people.</li>
                    </ul>

                  <h3>How I Feel About Studying Core</h3>
                  <p>
                    Studying core doesn't feel like a waste of time at all, it feels essential! I do need to be better at sticking to the time boxes, so that I have enough time to practice my programming too without staying up late. This balance will be important for me. Luckily, part of developing my core skills will be about sticking to a schedule and maintaining healthy balances.
