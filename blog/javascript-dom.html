        <h3>JavaScript | HTML & CSS</h3>
        <!--analogy between HTML & CSS-->    
            <p>When I learned about HTML and CSS last week, a beautiful transformation was simultaneously occuring at my house. Some tiny monarch caterpillars had grown big and plump, and they were ready to make their transition into their chyrsalis to become butterflies.
            While reflecting about HTML and CSS, I decided that HTML was like the caterpillar (specifically, the cells within a caterpillar which remain as it transforms into a butterfly), and that CSS was like the chrysalis, encasing the caterpillar and allowing the transformation into a beautiful butterfly (ie. a gorgeous webpage) to occur.</p>
            <p>What I've decided this week, is that JavaScript is like the instinct of a butterfly - it is linked to every aspect of its being (to the cells within and it's beauty without), and the intuition prompts the butterfly to "open wings and fly!" 
            The intuition can change the butterfly's actions depending on circumstance, and it will guide the butterfly throughout it's life. Intuition will direct it to visit certain flowers, to fold up it's wings and take shelter in the rain, to lay eggs on a swan plant, and so on.
            Intuition is what allowed the butterfly to crawl onto my finger when it had fallen into corner of the bathtub, and it's what instructed it to fly when it was set by the open window. </p>
            <p>If you took another creature to further the metaphor, you might look at the Mimic Octopus. 
            The Mimic Octopus can actually connect to it's intuition (JavaScript) to prompt it into action, changing the shape of its body (HTML) and the appearance of it's skin (CSS), to mimic other creatures and hide.
            The octopus is doing this in response to it's enviornment - if a predator appears, it will make a transformation instructed by it's intuition (similar to the change when a button is clicked on a website and JavaScript has instructed it to do make some sort of change).  </p>
            <p>In short: HTML is the strucutre of the creature, CSS is what decorates the structure, and JavaScript is what causes action - the action can be almost anything, even changing the structure and the decoration.</p>

        <h3>Control Flow & Loops, Arrays & Objects</h3>
        <!--Everyday example for control flow & loops-->
        <!--CONTROL FLOW-->
            <h4>Control Flow</h4>
            <p>With JavaScript's control flow, rather than JavaScript's code being read from top to bottom (as it is by default), a web developer can control how code is read and enacted based on a set of rules they put into place. I'll explain using something more relatable... gardening! Like my experience with learning web development learning how to garden, has been full of trial and error.</p> 
            <p>To be honest, my initial approach to gardening wasn't so good. I followed a path of what I thought should happen, (like the computer's default way of reading JavaScript code, from top to bottom, from A to B).</p>
            <p>To start my garden, I:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Cleared the glass house</li>
                    <li>Planted starters</li>
                    <li>Layed sheep pellets and peastraw</li>
                    <li>Watered regularly</li>
                    <li>Pulled the weeds</li>
                </ul>
            <p>... and I kind of just hoped that everything would be fine and it would thrive. What I didn't really plan for was how I might need to respond to certain paths that the plants took. For example, what to do if:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The tomatoes grow super tall and become heavy?</li>
                    <li>The herbs start to flower?</li>
                    <li>The snail population explodes?</li>
                    <li>The strawberries are tiny?</li>
                    <li>The passionfruit busts out of the glass and overtakes everything?</li>
                    <li>The birds find their way in through the hole in the glass?</li>
                </ul>
            <p>I don't want to waste prescious resources growing plants that don't reach their full potential, so I need to base my actions as a gardener on what I am seeing from the plants in the garden at the time.</p>
            <p>Let's say that I, the gardner is equivallent to JavaScript code talking to the web browser about how things should happen on the website (which we'll call the garden), and let's say the plants in the garden are a user interacting with a website. Wouldn't it be helpful if JavaScript (the gardner) could respond appropriately to the user (the plant's) signals, to display a live, dynamically responding site (like a thriving garden)?</p>
            <p>One way to change the flow of JavaScript is with conditional statements. Using the garden metaphor, conditional statements can work like this:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>If</strong> the tomatoes are tall,</li>
                    <p><strong>return</strong> with bamboo stakes and ties, and tie them up.</p>
                    <li><strong>Else if</strong> the leaves are droopy,</li>
                    <p><strong>return</strong> to the tap and turn on the water.</p>
                    </li><strong>Else</strong> (no signals from plant),</li>
                    <p><strong>return</strong> to pull some weeds.</p>
                </ul> 
            <p>These conditions will change the path that the gardner (JavaScript) takes, based on the signals or actions of the plant (the User inputs).</p>
        <!--LOOPS-->
            <h4>Loops</h4>
            <p>Another way that the JavaScript pathway through the code can be changed is through loops. Loops are useful when you want to repeate a task with less effort. For example, the gardner wants to water all of the plants, every morning in the summer, when the sun rises. If you had a drip system looping around the garden, and a special garden hose timer, you could set the timer so that in the summer, it would turn the water on once the daylight sensor was triggered, and you could even specify that you wanted it to run for three hours, so that you don't overwater the garden and kill the plants.</p>
            <p>Another way you could use a loop is if you had a set of soil sensors, one in each garden bed, and you pressed a button on a remote that sent out a signal to each sensor which boomeranged back a report of the moisture levels in each garden bed. Wouldn't that be handy?!</p>
        <!--difference between acessing data from arrays and objects-->
            <h4>Objects</h4>
            <p>Objects are like a magician's hat in which you can put anything that you like, without worrying about the size or shape of it, as long as you can describe it's characteristics, it can fit in the hat.</p> 
            <p>You might say, I want to put in a rabbit - the rabbit's name is 'Jack', it's age is 6 months, it's coat is long, it's color is white, it's eyes are red, it's attitude is grumpy... Or you might want to put in a scarf - the scarf is 10 metres long, it's color is blue, it's fiber is silk, it's type is chiffon... You could even put in something abstract, like a sunset - the time is 7.38pm, the weather is mild, the temperature is warm, the clouds are pink. The details of each thing in the hat are it's properties, made up of keys (like cloud) and values (like pink).</p>
            <p>What's great about these things that you've put in the hat, is that you can change them, remove them, and pull them out as you like. It's as easy as writing a note for the magician saying, "I'd like to know the what the fiber of the scarf is." You say this by calling up the item 'scarf' and the key of what you want to know 'fiber' and telling you that you want it to return that. "Tada!", as long as you've written the note after the object has been put in the hat, the magician will tell you, the fiber is 'silk'.</p>
            <h4>Arrays</h4>
            <p>Arrays are used to store cataloged collections of items. Think of a library which houses books. The books stored on a single shelf in a libary is analogous to a collection of items stored in an array. The books belong to a category, each book has it's own number, and the books are lined up in order of their unique number (but not alphabetically by their title), which helps people locate the book they'd like to read. The library number system doesn't always make perfect sense to the non-librarian, and similarly, the web developer's number system also doens't make perfect sense. The web developer counts items in an array starting at zero. Just like libary books, you can access items in an array by first finding their location number, then pulling them from their location number.</p>

        <h3>Functions are Useful! Here's Why...</h3>
            <p>Functions are useful as they are a list of instructions you give to a computer. By writing a list of instructions as a function, you will be able to display the information provided by the function again and again. You can also use the function to do produce different results, based on the data (aka. the argument) that you provide it. A function might be used to greet a user when logging into a website. When a user enters their log in information, the computer will be able to pull data about the user and say "Welcome back, Elysia!" If another person named Jane logged into the site, JavaScript would use the same function to say "Welcome back, Jane!"

        <h3>The DOM and DevTools</h3>
        <!--definition of the DOM-->
        <!--how one interacts with the DOM-->
        <p>Dev Tools is a tool that's like little programming window, which can be accessed via Google Chrome to allow a knowledgeable person to inspect and interact with the code for a web page via the Document Object Model (DOM). The DOM is like a 3 dimensional x-ray, birds-eye view of a New York city. Dev Tools is like your navigation tool, which allows you to zoom into different parts of the x-ray view, select and manipulate specific elements. In the DOM, you can see every aspect of your webpage (in this example, New York city) - you can see the structure of the buildings is HTML, the look of the city is CSS, and all the cars and people running around are like JavaScript.  Sometimes, the people use machines to build new buildings and change the appearance of the city, just like JavaScript can change HTML and CSS. Let's say that in this scenario, you, the web developer, get to play some all knowing, all seeing figure using Dev Tools from the clouds. From your bird's eye view, you can go into the DOM, to check out all of your creations, test out new ideas, try out different colors and text, copy and insert new things, and once you're happy with the changes you'd like to make, you can even bring them to life through the sources tab in Dev Tools. Dev Tools allows the mighty web developer to navigate the DOM simply by, selecting with a click, different elements of the page, which then point directly to the related node. </p>
