        <h3>JavaScript | HTML & CSS</h3>
        <!--analogy between HTML & CSS-->    
            <p>When I learned about HTML and CSS last week, a beautiful transformation was simultaneously occuring at my house. Some tiny monarch caterpillars had grown big and plump, and they were ready to make their transition into their chyrsalis to become butterflies.
            While reflecting about HTML and CSS, I decided that HTML was like the caterpillar (specifically, the cells within a caterpillar which remain as it transforms into a butterfly), and that CSS was like the chrysalis, encasing the caterpillar and allowing the transformation into a beautiful butterfly (ie. a gorgeous webpage) to occur.
            </p>
            <br>
            What I've decided this week, is that JavaScript is like the instinct of a butterfly - it is linked to every aspect of its being (to the cells within and it's beauty without), and the intuition prompts the butterfly to "open wings and fly!" 
            The intuition can change the butterfly's actions depending on circumstance, and it will guide the butterfly throughout it's life. Intuition will direct it to visit certain flowers, to fold up it's wings and take shelter in the rain, to lay eggs on a swan plant, and so on.
            Intuition is what allowed the butterfly to crawl onto my finger when it had fallen into corner of the bathtub, and it's what instructed it to fly when it was set by the open window.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>If you took another creature to further the metaphor, you might look at the Mimic Octopus. 
            The Mimic Octopus can actually connect to it's intuition (JavaScript) to prompt it into action, changing the shape of its body (HTML) and the appearance of it's skin (CSS), to mimic other creatures and hide.
            The octopus is doing this in response to it's enviornment - if a predator appears, it will make a transformation instructed by it's intuition (similar to the change when a button is clicked on a website and JavaScript has instructed it to do make some sort of change). 
            </p>
            <p>In short - HTML is the strucutre of the creature, CSS is what decorates the structure, and JavaScript is what causes action - the action can be almost anything, even changing the structure and the decoration.</p>
