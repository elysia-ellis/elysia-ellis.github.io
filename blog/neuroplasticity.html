    <h2>Neuroplasticity </h2>

    <h3>Benefits of Neuroplasticity</h3>
      <p>The brain is an incredibly complex organ, with billions of nerve cells wired to each other, sending signals that trigger our psychological (mind) and physiological (body) responses. This wiring connects our nervous systems to our brain, and the responses sent through the wiring can be desirable or undesirable, in alignment or in misalignment with our true selves (the true self encompases our values, goals, emotions, needs with love and compassion for ourselves).</p>
      <p>Many of our brain's wirings come from our childhood, after all, that is when we are going through rapid development - learning how to walk, speak, learn and respond to social situations and our environment. If it wasn't for the neuroplasticity in our brain, we wouldn't be able to form the neurological connections that enable us to do these things. The neurological connections were forming long before we could have had any awareness that they were forming - the results of these neural wirings would have likely resulted in both some positive, and some negative habits. Additional neurological wiring occurs through education, family and social experiences, our own actions, the actions we witness, things we were repetitively told or thought.</p>
      <p>Have you ever known someone who suffered a brain injury and lost their ability to do something like speak, but with focus, effort, and practice, they were able to regain that ability? Neuroplasticity, the ability of the brain to add to and modify it's connections, allows this incredible restoration of skill to occur.</p>
      <p>As one gets older and becomes more self-aware, it's not uncommon to wonder, why does my brain have this response? This feels uncontrollable... Why are these emotions and thoughts arising? How can I change them? This doesn't feel in alignment with my true self, who I want to be in this moment and the direction I want to go in future. One may recognise compulsive behaviors, anxiety, depression, and/or habits that feel unhelpful for making progress in goals and for living a happy, healthy life. One may also recognise beneficial responses within themselves that they'd like to have more of.</p>
      <p>The good news is that it is possible to build new positive habits and even release thought patterns and emotional responses that we don't want to continue, so that we can be more in alignment with our true selves, and even have a positive influence on those we come into contact with.</p>
      <p>Our brains are constantly wiring and rewiring themselves. Forming new connections between our nerve cells, and releasing connections which are not being utilised. Some connections are deep and wide, they are well trodden paths that are easily triggered, and they may take longer to re-wire and release. Other connections might be thin and delicate, even incomplete, and they will take time to strengthen and automate.</p>
      <p>An understanding of neuroplasticity can empower people. The knowledge that patience, persistence, repetition, practice, and mindfulness, can help reshape and rewire the brain with positive outcomes can inspire a person to overcome difficulties, develop new skills, and form positive habits.</p>
      <p>As human beings, we have a unique ability to become the architect of our brain's neural pathways, and this knowledge can prompt us into nourishing and creating neural pathways that will help us become in alignment with our true self, which will ultimately lead to living a fulfilling life.</p>

      <h3>Personal Use of Neuroplasticity</h3>
      <p>A great thing about neuroplasticity is that you can strengthen neural pathways using only your imagination. I have a strong imagination, and I would like to use this skillfully, to envision things the way that I'd like them to be, to imagine and hopefully manifest positive outcomes in situations. I'd also like to recall experiences which evoked positive responses (such as good feelings like enthusiasm) that I want to have easier access to.</p>
      <p>I'd like to be able to connect easily to a place of calm within myself even when facing challenges, so that if I start to feel anxious, I can take a moment to consciously shift into a state of mindfulness. I can close my eyes, focus on my breath, and envision myself in a beautiful setting, filled with serenity. I can then return to the problem with a clear mind, so that I can evaluate it from a place of how can I solve this problem? What might someone who I think is really wise do in this situation?</p>
      <p>Rather than focusing on the existing neural pathways which are evoking unwanted responses, I can start by focusing on forming new pathways with positive responses. This way, I am directing my energy towards where I want it to grow. Once I have gained a stronger mindfulness practice, I can return to the areas that I see problematic, if they still exist, with more compassion and an ability to examine them with strong mindfulness practices which have become more instinctual.</p>
      <p>Another thing that I can do is relate my new learnings to my previous positive experiences, and put things into context. This will help me engrain the new learnings faster.</p>
      <p>Repetitive, structured, regular, deliberate practice is going to be key for learning web development, and any other skill that I want to acquire.</p>
      <p>Taking the time to set my intentions will be important for me. If I am aware of my intentions each day, I can remind myself of them which will help strengthen the neural connections that allow them to manifest.</p>
      <p>Recognising deceptive brain messages will also be important for me. My brain sends me a lot of messages, filtering through these and labeling the ones that are false as false will help me reframe them and refocus my intent, essentially debugging my own mind.</p>

      <h3>Ways to Increase Neuroplasticity</h3>
      <p>Dr Jeffery M Schwartz, author of 'You are not your brain' had some wonderful suggestions for constructively changing the brain in a talk that he presented at Mind & Its Potential 2011, and it has to do with recognising cognitive distortion, and changing the narrative. He noted the four steps are:</p>
      <ol>
        <li><em><strong>RELABEL</strong> - Identify the intrusive thoughts and urges as uncomfortable sensations. Call them what they really are.</em></li>
        <li><em><strong> REFRAME</strong> - Say why these thoughts and urges keep bothering you. They are false brain messages (It's NOT ME, it's just my BRAIN!)</em></li>
        <li><em><strong>REFOCUS</strong> - Direct your attention by focusing your attention on something else, that is productive and wholesome; DO ANOTHER (productive, wholesome) BEHAVIOR.</em></li>
        <li><em><strong>REVALUE</strong> - Do not take the thoughts and urges at face value. They are simply sensations caused by deceptive brain messages.</em></li> 
      </ol>
      <p>Dr. Schwartz also noted what qualifies as cognitive distortion (something which can be addressed through cognitive therapy). Cognitive distortion includes:</p>
      <ul>
          <em><li>black and white thinking</li>
          <li>catastrophizing</li>
          <li>discounting the positive</li>
          <li>emotional reasoning (in which we let our feelings control our thoughts)</li>
          <li>mind reading / projecting</li>
          <li>should statements  (bad should statements put shame on you)</li>
          <li>negative comparison (that brings yourself shame and makes you think badly of yourself)</li>
          <li>false expectation (thinking that because someone does something, it means something negative)</li></em>
      </ul>

    <h3>Growth Mindset Summary</h3>
      <p>A growth mindset is about knowing and believing that one is capable of growing skills and intelligence, that one can improve through training and practice</p>
      <p>Traits of a person with a growth mindset include:</p>
      <ul>
          <li>Embracing challenges and obstacles, recognising them as opportunities for growth</li>
          <li>Seeing hurdles rather than roadblocks</li>
          <li>Preservering towards a dream, knowing that it takes effort to reach it, and appreciating the journey to achieve it</li>
          <li>Knowing that a failure in a task does not mean a failure in oneself</li>
          <li>Understanding the benefit of feedback, having gratitude for it, and incorporating it into future actions</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Growth Mindset Learnings</h3>
      <p>American Psychologist and Professor of Psychology at Stanford University, Dr. Carol Dweck explained in a ted talk, taht through her studies with struggling young students (some children from low decile environments), showed that when they were informed of neuroplasticity, their growth mindset skyrocketed and they were able to completely transform their intellect and become super high performing, top ranking students/schools, even outperforming the rich seattle microsoft kids. I was surprised by those results and it made me think about people I've encountered in life who had difficult upbringings. It made me think about how I can speak to others, and how I will consciously change the way I interact with people with an aim to serve their growth mindset, as opposed to handing out compliments that might enforce a belief that skill and talent are innate.</p>
      <p>I particularly apprecaited Dr. Dweck's suggestion of the "not yet" assessment, and will remind myself of this when I face obstacles that I have not yet overcome - it's not that I can't overcome them, it's just not yet. I also aim to shift my mindset into seeing challenges as opportunities.</p>

      <h3>Learning Strategy Update</h3>
      <p>Learning about neuroplasticity and growth mindset will shape my learning strategy by helping me have more compassion for myself throughout the process of learning. I have noticed that I can be really difficult on myself when I feel that I am not learning new things as quickly as I think I should be, and this mindset is very unhelpful. I'm going to get rid of "should" statements and comparison. I will focus on celebrating small successes to rewire my brain to look at the bright side of accomplishments as opposed to being hyper-critical. I can still reflect, but with the mindset of what have I learned from this experience. If I face a challenge that I can't complete, I will not beat myself up about it - I will say "not yet!" and put it on my list to circle back and try tackling again.</p>
