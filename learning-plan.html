    <h1>My Learning Plan</h1>
    <div id="bootcamp-learn-plan">
      <h2>Bootcamp (as at: 06/03/2022)</h2>
        <h3>Career Goals</h3>
          <p>
            My long term goal is to have a career that is meaningful, sustainable, involves regular collaboration with a team that has trust in each other and that supports each other's growth and development. I want to have a career that involves art and design, and is serving a greater good. I want to be building things that help people. I'd like to achieve a healthy work/life balance, and part of this is doing work that I feel has a positive purpose, and working with companies that care about their employees as human beings. I want to work for a company that invests in it's employee's development, and that has an awesome workplace culture that I can be a part of and positively contribute to. A goal of mine is to be able to travel to different countries (particularly to be able to go to the US more often), and to be able to take my work with me if I feel it would be productive to do so. Part of this is a long term goal, to be able to work independently at times with some flexibility in creating my own schedule. I'd like a career that pays well, so that I can take care of my and my family's human needs without stress, and so that I can also do nice things for myself and for others, and to be able to contribute to good causes.
          </p>
        <h3>My Future Plans</h3>
          <p>
            I hope to use the skills I gain to build beautifully designed, easy to navigate, useful websites and applications for companies that are building them to benefit the end-user first.
          </p>
          <p>
            I want to use my time to create things for the good of the people. Websites and apps that will make it easier for people to do things that they want to, understand things that will be beneficial to have knowledge of, and bring more joy and beauty into their lives.
          </p>
          <p>
            When I leave Dev Academy, I want to be a person who can bring skills, knowledge, and ideas to the table. I want to be a person who meets others with enthusiasm, who helps lift the energy and is caring and empathetic in all of my interactions.
          </p>
          <p>
            I have my eye on several companies! While my research is still underway, I've found Wellington companies who have a focus on clear, user-centered design and who illustrate a genuine care about the people who work at their company. It's so exciting to read about what kind of people companies are looking for, and to think about whether I could be one of them at the end of this course.
          </p>
        <h3 id="bootcamp-strengths">Strengths</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>My biggest strength is empathy. I care about other people and I believe that I am good at sensing other people.</li>
            <li>Collaboration is a skill that I have practiced in and I believe will be useful.</li>
            <li>My attention to detail and design background will likely be strengths that I will draw upon.</li>
          </ul>
        <h3 id="bootcamp-weakness">Weaknesses</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>
              My attention to detail can also be a weakness. I need to be careful that I employ this at the right time, rather than too early in the process.
            </li>
            <li>
              My biggest limitation is my technical skills. I thought that I had good general technical skills with computers, but web development requires a whole new set of computer skills. Foundations has taught me that I need more practice with coding to have the technical skills required to be successful in this career path.
            </li>
            <li>
              Getting into the web developer mindset so that I can be effective at problem solving in my coding, is a muscle that I need to exercise more. I need to be able to move past any initial anxiousness that I may encounter and view problem solving with an outlook of curiosity and wonder.
            </li>
            <li>
              Fear is another weakness that can sometimes arise - fear of failure.
            </li>
          </ul>
        <h3>Strengths and Weaknesses: Now vs. Foundations</h3>
          <p>
            I feel that what I wrote in Sprint 2 of Foundations about my <a href="#foundations-strengths">strengths</a> and <a href="#foundations-weakness">weaknesses</a> still applies, but the experience of Foundations has allowed me to be more focused and concise about what skills I bring, and what I need to work on to be successful in Bootcamp.
          </p>
        <h3>Biggest Non-Technical Challenge</h3>
          <p>
            Speaking in front of groups, and showing up as my true self in front of groups will be a big hurdle for me.
          </p>
        <h3>Human Skills to Develop</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Problem-solving</li>
            <li>Judgement and decision-making</li>
            <li>Planning and workload management</li>
            <li>Creative thinking</li>
            <li>Time management / self control</li>
            <li>Teamwork</li>
            <li>Giving and receiving feedback</li>
          </ul>
        <h3>General expectations for the Bootcamp Team</h3>
          <p>
            I'd like for the Bootcamp team to:

            <li>Support me along this journey, providing guidance where I need it;</li>
            <li>Let me know if they see any signs of trouble or gaps in my learning and understanding;</li>
            <li>Support me with information and/or help me brainstorm ways to resolve any trouble or gaps in my knowledge;</li>
            <li>Help me grow my core and technical skills so that at the end of this course, I can be a great candidate for work as a web developer.</li>
          </ul>
        <h3>Support Request for the Bootcamp Team</h3>
          <p>
            I would be grateful for support that includes:

            <li>Put in my best effort</li>
          </ul>
        <h3>Seeking Help</h3>
          <p>
            I will seek help during my check-ins and my tech-ins. If something arises urgently, I will not wait to bring this up, I will reach out to the Bootcamp team. I will also reach out to my cohort if I have questions that they may be able to help me with.
          </p>
        <h3>Commitment to Managing Myself</h3>  
          <p>
            To manage my workload in this program, I will manage myself by:

            <li>Putting in my best effort</li>
            <li>Getting enough sleep</li>
            <li>Doing activities that will help keep my mood bright and my body healthy, like going for a walk and having a dedicated mindfulness practice</li>
            <li>Moving past any anxious feelings or fixed mindsets that may arise with mindfulness</li>              
          </ul>
          <p>
            I will work safely and productively with others by:

          <p>
            My long-term goal is to have a fulfilling career that engages and values my curiosity, creativity, empathy, compassion, and organisational skills.

        <h3>Collaboration</h3>
          <p>
            <strong>When I work with others, I will ensure that:</strong>
          </p>
            <ul>
              <li>I am respecting others' space and boundaries</li>
              <li>If I need help, I will ask for help through a channel which allows people who are available and happy to assist me to do so</li>
              <li>If I feel that I can offer helpful support to someone in need, I will offer it - I won't be offended if they decide that they don't want my help</li>
              <li>I maintain a flexible mindset</li>
              <li>I follow through with my word</li>
              <li>I do not share information that has been provided to me in confidence, unless it is something that would cause harm to a person if not shared</li>

            </ul>
        <h3>Learning - Areas for Improvement</h3>
          <p>
            <strong>Things that I struggle with:</strong>
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Time management - tendency to feel anxious around deadlines</li>
            <li>Erratic sleep/wake schedule when feeling under pressure - tendency to push myself beyond healthy limits without enough sleep</li>
            <li>Wanting to memorise what I am learning right away</li>
            <li>Perfectionism and diving too deep into research</li>
            <li>Affected by other's energy</li>
            <li>Affected by environments</li>
          </ul>
        <h3 id="foundations-weakness">Skills to Develop</h3>
          <p>
            As an introverted cancerian, it can take me a while to feel comfortable around new people, but I don't like hanging out in my shell all the time. I find that my interactions are better with people when I am playful and open, rather than quiet and shy. I hope that this career pathway increases my self-confidence and allows me to truly be myself at all times.
          </p>
          <p>
            I would also like to develop my leadership skills. I have been around a lot of strong leaders and feel that I have some of the skills required to become a good leader, but again, I need to increase my confidence in this area.
          </p>
          <p>
            I would love to get a better handle on my time management skills. I have developed some perfectionistic tendencies through my prior study and work experience. This has served me well in circumstances where attention to detail is critical, but I also feel that perfectionism can get in the way of moving forward. Done is better than perfect. Sometimes wanting perfection prevents me from getting things done in a timely fashion, which increases my stress levels.
          </p>
          <p>
            It would be amazing to know how to work with difficult personalities productively and in a way that doesn't affect me emotionally.
          </p>

        <h3>Responsible Back Up Plan</h3>
          <p>
            <strong>If things start to build up on me, I will:</strong>
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Step back and take a moment to reflect</li>
            <li>Assess my list, set obtainable goals, and re-prioritise as needed</li>
            <li>Communicate with my facilitator in a timely fashion</li>
            <li>Inform project collaborators in a timely fashion</li>
            <li></li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            <strong>If I get stuck, I will:</strong>
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Seek help from my classmates and/or facilitator via Slack if I get stuck for more than 20 minutes</li>
          </ul>
          <h3>Support Request</h3>
            <p>
              <strong>Ways in which the facilitators can support me inlude:</strong>
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Guiding me to work in best practice ways</li>
              <li>Encouraging me to form positive tiny habits that will help with my workflow</li>
              <li>Helping me to seek and find the most simple and straightforward solutions </li>
              <li>If I am drifting towards a path that is too complicated or appears unhelpful for my learning experience, I would be grateful for someone to talk with me about strategies for getting back on track</li>
              <li>The technical aspect of this course is all new information and has been challenging for me to wrap my head around. It would be awesome to focus on this with my facilitator during our catch ups</li>
              <li>I would appreciate help to ensure that I am meeting the learning expectations so that if there is something that I am not understanding, it can be clarified early in the process</li>
              <li>Encouragement and moral support</li>
            </ul>
