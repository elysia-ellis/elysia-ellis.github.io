    <h1>My Learning Plan</h1>

        <h3>Career Goals</h3>
          <p>
            My long-term goal is to have a fulfilling career that engages and values my curiosity, creativity, empathy, compassion, and organisational skills. Having a career that contributes to my growth and learning is importat to me. I want to have a career that allows me to use my skills to make a positive contribution to society.

I'd like a career that is moving into the future and that can provide me with both stability and fun/exciting opportinities.

        <h3>Collaboration</h3>
          <p>
            <strong>When I work with others, I will ensure that:</strong>
          </p>
            <ul>
              <li>I am respecting others' space and boundaries</li>
              <li>If I need help, I will ask for help through a channel which allows people who are available and happy to assist me to do so</li>
              <li>If I feel that I can offer helpful support to someone in need, I will offer it - I won't be offended if they decide that they don't want my help</li>
              <li>I maintain a flexible mindset</li>
              <li>I follow through with my word</li>
              <li>I do not share information that has been provided to me in confidence, unless it is something that would cause harm to a person if not shared</li>
              <li>I practice active listening</li>
              <li>I ask insightful and helpful questions where appropriate</li>
              <li>I do not gossip or speak ill of others</li>
              <li>If I witness bad behavior, I stand up to it with non-violent communication</li>
              <li>I treat others with respect and act with compassion</li>
            </ul>
        <h3>Learning - Areas for Improvement</h3>
          <p>
            <strong>Things that I struggle with:</strong>
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Time management - tendency to feel anxious around deadlines</li>
            <li>Erratic sleep/wake schedule when feeling under pressure - tendency to push myself beyond healthy limits without enough sleep</li>
            <li>Wanting to memorise what I am learning right away</li>
            <li>Perfectionism and diving too deep into research</li>
            <li>Affected by other's energy</li>
            <li>Affected by environments</li>
          </ul>
        <h3>Skills to Develop</h3>
          <p>
            As an introverted cancerian, it can take me a while to feel comfortable around new people, but I don't like hanging out in my shell all the time. I find that my interactions are better with people when I am playful and open, rather than quiet and shy. I hope that this career pathway increases my self-confidence and allows me to truly be myself at all times.
          </p>
          <p>
            I would also like to develop my leadership skills. I have been around a lot of strong leaders and feel that I have some of the skills required to become a good leader, but again, I need to increase my confidence in this area.
          </p>
          <p>
            I would love to get a better handle on my time management skills. I have developed some perfectionistic tendencies through my prior study and work experience. This has served me well in circumstances where attention to detail is critical, but I also feel that perfectionism can get in the way of moving forward. Done is better than perfect. Sometimes wanting perfection prevents me from getting things done in a timely fashion, which increases my stress levels.
          </p>
          <p>
            It would be amazing to know how to work with difficult personalities productively and in a way that doesn't affect me emotionally.
          </p>
        <h3>Responsible Back Up Plan</h3>
          <p>
            <strong>If things start to build up on me, I will:</strong>
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Step back and take a moment to reflect</li>
            <li>Assess my list, set obtainable goals, and re-prioritise as needed</li>
            <li>Communicate with my facilitator in a timely fashion</li>
            <li>Inform project collaborators in a timely fashion</li>
            <li></li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            <strong>If I get stuck, I will:</strong>
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Seek help from my classmates and/or facilitator via Slack if I get stuck for more than 20 minutes</li>
          </ul>
          <h3>Support Request</h3>
            <p>
              <strong>Ways in which the facilitators can support me inlude:</strong>
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Guiding me to work in best practice ways</li>
              <li>Encouraging me to form positive tiny habits that will help with my workflow</li>
              <li>Helping me to seek and find the most simple and straightforward solutions </li>
              <li>If I am drifting towards a path that is too complicated or appears unhelpful for my learning experience, I would be grateful for someone to talk with me about strategies for getting back on track</li>
              <li>The technical aspect of this course is all new information and has been challenging for me to wrap my head around. It would be awesome to focus on this with my facilitator during our catch ups</li>
              <li>I would appreciate help to ensure that I am meeting the learning expectations so that if there is something that I am not understanding, it can be clarified early in the process</li>
              <li>Encouragement and moral support</li>
            </ul>
